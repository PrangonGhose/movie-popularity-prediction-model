<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Project Name

## Web Scrapping & Movie Popularity Prediction Model

## About this project <a name="about-project"></a>

The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model from a non existing database to predict the popularity of a movie based on several features. The database is collected using web scrapping technique. In this project the website named [Sens Critique](https://www.senscritique.com/) has been used for scrapping to collect necessary data.

**N.B. The author does not support web scrapping for piracy or any sort of unauthorized use of data from any website. This project is for education purpose only.**

## 🛠 Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

- `Python3`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `SQLLite3`

<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- 500 pages of the website containing 16 movies each is scrapped and about page of each movie is also scrapped to collect necessary data.
- This project is a great example of scrapping dynamically loaded data on a website.
- Several features are considered in order to build the machine learning model for the prediction of a movie popularity.
- The project uses `selenium` package to simulate a browser experience in order to load every page smoothly.
- `Pandas` is used to generate a dataframe.

## 💻 Getting Started
To clone the repository in local environment try following steps.

### Prerequisites

- [x] A web browser like Google Chrome.
- [x] A code editor like Visual Studio Code with `Git`, `Python3`, `Pandas`, `Selenium`.

You can check if Git is installed by running the following command in the terminal.
```
$ git --version
```

Likewise for `python` and `pip` for package installation.
```bash
$ python --version
